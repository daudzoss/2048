 * \section internalWelcome Welcome to the PIC24 library collection!
The \ref PIC24_support "PIC24 support library" and \ref textbookExamples "example code",
 accompanied by detailed explanations in the textbook, 
 supplemented with numerous real-world examples, and accompanied by extensive on-line documentation given below, 
 enable developers to take advantage of the wide range of peripherals offered by the PIC24. 
 The collection consists of the getting started guide; the PIC24 support library; 
 ESOS, the Embedded Systems Operating System; and the robotics library, each of which is overviewed below.
 The latest version of this code is located <a href="http://www.ece.msstate.edu/courses/ece3724/main_pic24/labs/files/pic24_code_examples.zip">here</a>.

 * \section internalStarted Getting started
The \ref gettingStarted "getting started" page walks newcomers through the first step in developing for the PIC24: 
installing software and obtaining necessary hardware. Next, examples introduce use of the libraries below. 
Finally, documentation below provides a detailed reference to each of the library's operation.

* \section internalSupport PIC24 support library

The \ref PIC24_support "PIC24 support library" supports all the major subsystems of the PIC24: 
clock configuration, configuration bits, delays, interrupts, 
digital I/O, timers, serial I/O, SPI, I2C, ECAN, comparators, A/D conversion, FLASH reads/writes, and DMA. 
An extensive set of examples accompanying the library provide working sample code to guide newcomers to using the library.
* \section internalESOS ESOS
\ref ESOS, the Embedded Systems Operating System, is a cooperative multitasking operating system with 
very low memory overhead. ESOS is a task-driven programming paradigm within an event-driven framework. 
ESOS gives the user timer, interrupt, and communication services commonly needed in embedded systems programs.
